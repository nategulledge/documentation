<p>ReachSmart has given me repeated opportunities to go beyond their basic design needs to create thoughtful, eye-catching projects for corporate entities, special events, and internet marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>By working on websites and landing pages, I have continued to refine my design abilities while adding more front-end development skills. Over the past year, I have taken on minor backend-development tasks which has sparked a desire to learn more PHP and Python.</p>
       
<p>My improvement as a designer, developer, and communicator is thanks in part to being a member of a design team that values creativity, constructive criticism, and learning.</p>
